Typically, users would have to get permission to install Spark/Scala on some subset of the machines, a process that could be time consuming. SIMR allows anyone with access to a Hadoop MapReduce v1 cluster to run Spark out of the box. A user can run Spark directly on top of Hadoop MapReduce v1 without any administrative rights, and without having Spark or Scala installed on any of the nodes.</p></td>

YARN stands for “Yet-Another-Resource-Negotiator”. It is a new framework that facilitates writing arbitrary distributed processing frameworks and applications. YARN’s execution model is more generic than the earlier MapReduce implementation. YARN can run applications that do not follow the MapReduce model, unlike the original Apache Hadoop MapReduce (also called MR1). Hadoop YARN is an attempt to take Apache Hadoop beyond MapReduce for data-processing.</p></td>

<td><p>GridGain is open source project licensed under Apache 2.0. One of the main pieces of this platform is the In-Memory Apache Hadoop Accelerator which aims to accelerate HDFS and Map/Reduce by bringing both, data and computations into memory. This work is done with the GGFS - Hadoop compliant in-memory file system. For I/O intensive jobs GridGain GGFS offers performance close to 100x faster than standard HDFS. Paraphrasing Dmitriy Setrakyan from GridGain Systems talking about GGFS regarding Tachyon: GGFS allows read-through and write-through to/from underlying HDFS or any other Hadoop compliant file system with zero code change. Essentially GGFS entirely removes ETL step from integration.GGFS has ability to pick and choose what folders stay in memory, what folders stay on disc, and what folders get synchronized with underlying (HD)FS either synchronously or asynchronously. GridGain is working on adding native MapReduce component which will provide native complete Hadoop integration without changes in API, like Spark currently forces you to do. Essentially GridGain MR+GGFS will allow to bring Hadoop completely or partially in-memory in Plug-n-Play fashion without any API changes.</p></td>

ZooKeeper is an application library with two principal implementations of the APIs—Java and C—and a service component implemented in Java that runs on an ensemble of dedicated servers. Zookeeper is for building distributed systems, simplifies the development process, making it more agile and enabling more robust implementations. Back in 2006, Google published a paper on &#8220;Chubby&#8221;, a distributed lock service which gained wide adoption within their data centers. Zookeeper, not surprisingly, is a close clone of Chubby designed to fulfill many of the same roles for HDFS and other Hadoop infrastructure.</p></td>

Later VMware, and its parent company EMC Corporation, formally created a joint venture called Pivotal. Spring XD is more than development framework library, is a distributed, and extensible system for data ingestion, real time analytics, batch processing, and data export. It could be considered as alternative to Apache Flume/Sqoop/Oozie in some scenarios. Spring XD is part of Pivotal Spring for Apache Hadoop (SHDP). SHDP, integrated with Spring, Spring Batch and Spring Data are part of the Spring IO Platform as foundational libraries. Building on top of, and extending this foundation, the Spring IO platform provides Spring XD as big data runtime. Spring for Apache Hadoop (SHDP) aims to help simplify the development of Hadoop based applications by providing a consistent configuration and API across a wide range of Hadoop ecosystem projects such as Pig, Hive, and Cascading in addition to providing extensions to Spring Batch for orchestrating Hadoop based workflows.</p></td>

Falcon’s simplification of data management is quite useful to anyone building apps on Hadoop. Data Management on Hadoop encompasses data motion, process orchestration, lifecycle management, data discovery, etc. among other concerns that are beyond ETL.

Sparrow is designed for applications that require resource allocations frequently for very short jobs, such as analytics frameworks. Sparrow schedules from a distributed set of schedulers that maintain no shared state. Instead, to schedule a job, a scheduler obtains intantaneous load information by sending probes to a subset of worker machines. The scheduler places the job&#8217;s tasks on the least loaded of the probed workers. This technique allows Sparrow to schedule in milliseconds, two orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches. Sparrow also handles failures: if a scheduler fails, a client simply directs scheduling requests to an alternate scheduler</p></td>

Conjecture has been designed with a primary emphasis on flexibility and can handle a wide variety of inputs. Integration with Hadoop and scalding enable seamless handling of extremely large data volumes, and integration with established ETL processes. Predicted labels can either be consumed directly by the web stack using the dataset loader, or models can be deployed and consumed by live web code. Currently, binary classification (assigning one of two possible labels to input data points) is the most mature component of the Conjecture package.</p></td>
