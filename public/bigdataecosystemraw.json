It’s the service base for Facebook technologies (the original Thrift contributor). Thrift provides a framework for developing and accessing remote services. It allows developers to create services that can be consumed by any application that is written in a language that there are Thrift bindings for. Thrift manages serialization of data to and from a service, as well as the protocol that describes a method invocation, response, etc. Instead of writing all the RPC code -- you can just get straight to your service logic.

The current Hadoop implementation of the MapReduce technique uses a single job tracker, which causes scaling issues for very large data sets. The Apache Hadoop developers have been creating their own next-generation MapReduce, called YARN, which Facebook engineers looked at but discounted because of the highly-customised nature of the company's deployment of Hadoop and HDFS.\nCorona, like YARN, spawns multiple job trackers (one for each job, in Corona's case).

Paraphrasing Dmitriy Setrakyan from GridGain Systems talking about GGFS regarding Tachyon: GGFS allows read-through and write-through to/from underlying HDFS or any other Hadoop compliant file system with zero code change. Essentially GGFS entirely removes ETL step from integration.GGFS has ability to pick and choose what folders stay in memory, what folders stay on disc, and what folders get synchronized with underlying (HD)FS either synchronously or asynchronously. GridGain is working on adding native MapReduce component which will provide native complete Hadoop integration without changes in API, like Spark currently forces you to do. Essentially GridGain MR+GGFS will allow to bring Hadoop completely or partially in-memory in Plug-n-Play fashion without any API changes.
